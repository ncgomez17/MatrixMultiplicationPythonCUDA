# MatrixMultiplicationPythonCUDA
Matrix multiplication with different algorithms using python with CUDA(Numba is also used)

This work will take a critical look at different performance techniques such as tiling,memory coalescing, perfecting, and loop unrolling, in trying toevaluate which method is the most efficient approach for ourproblem set (matrix multiplication of n size matrices)
